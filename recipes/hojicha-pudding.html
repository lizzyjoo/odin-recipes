    <ol>
        <li>Add 1.5 teaspoons of hojicha powder, 1 tablespoon of tapioca powder starch, 1.5 of tablespoons sugar, and a pinch of salt into a small saucepan. Mix well until no white streaks remain.</li>
        <li>Add 20 ml of cold water, and mix until the dry ingredients are fully dissolved and form a thick paste.</li>
        <li>Add 100 ml of your choice of milk and stir well.</li>
        <li>Heat the mixture over medium heat, while stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>As soon as the mixture begins to steam, lower the heat to medium low. Then stir continuously while making sure to scrape the bottom.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat right before the mixture reaches your desired firmness, as the pudding will continue to thicken as it cools.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pour into a jar and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Serve your hojicha pudding chilled or at room temperature.</li>
