TOP project: Recipes
This is my first project for The Odin Project Fundamentals course. 
I have learned the foundations of HTML (boilerplate set-up, working with texts, unordered and ordered lists, links, and images.)

All three recipes and images (except for the latte) were taken from this site: https://hojicha.co/
The image used for the Hojicha latte was obtained from: https://theheirloompantry.co/hojicha-latte-iced-and-hot/
